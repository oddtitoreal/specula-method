# Specula Method

## Strategic Foresight Branding

Specula is a strategic design method that uses futures as tools to build living, adaptive brand identities oriented toward preferable scenarios. Born from the intersection of speculative design, brand strategy, and generative artificial intelligence, it helps organizations and teams imagine possible worlds and transform those visions into decisions, prototypes, and operational narratives.

### The Problem We Address

Traditional branding shows evident structural limitations: generic purposes, campaigns chasing ephemeral trends, identities consumed at the speed of feeds. The problem is primarily imaginative: many brands continue describing the present while their audience is already elsewhere, projected—consciously or not—into desired, feared, ambivalent futures.

Specula works precisely on this gap. The starting point is no longer "how do we position ourselves in today's market?" but "what futures do we want to help make possible?" From there, we work backward, designing identities, products, services, and AI agents that can operate in those futures without losing deep coherence.

## Core Principles

The framework is designed to be:

- **Speculative**: Starts from multiple scenarios, not a single linear prediction
- **AI-Assisted**: Uses generative models to expand the field of possibilities, not to replace human judgment
- **Values-Anchored**: Structurally integrates explicit ethical DNA and a refusal policy
- **Measurable**: Includes impact indicators and review mechanisms from the start
- **Evolutionary**: Configures a continuous device (Specula Guardian) that monitors gaps between imagined future and emerging reality

## The Six-Phase Method

### Phase 1 — Scenario Generation
Opening the field through multiple possible and desirable futures. Uses desk analysis, interviews, explorative sessions, and AI to analyze weak signals and unusual correlations, combining cultural, technological, economic, regulatory, and environmental drivers.

### Phase 1.5 — Competitive Futures Mapping
Analyzing competitors' speculative trajectories: not just present campaigns, but research investments, partnerships, emerging languages, narrative territories they're occupying. The goal is to find the "white spaces"—futures no one is credibly presiding over yet.

### Phase 2 — Brand Archeology
Excavating what must remain stable across multiple scenarios: radical values, worldview, forms of care, inviolable limits. Uses the **Speculative Identity Model**: a canvas working on six intertwined dimensions—radical values, persona/entity, agency, speculative interactions, preferable horizons, alternative tools and metrics.

### Phase 3 — Future Prototyping & Ethical Gate
Testing the brand in different futures through speculative design exercises, storytelling, service storyboards, narrative and conversational interfaces. Includes the **Resilience Protocol**: four stress-test scenarios (recession, regulatory revolution, technological discontinuity, plus a Wild Card black swan).

The **Ethical Gate** is a formal checkpoint asking:
- Does this scenario violate declared radical values?
- Does it introduce manipulative, extractive, or exclusionary practices?
- Does it create unacceptable technological, social, or environmental dependencies?

Rejected prototypes are logged in the **Registry of Refusals**—what the brand chose not to become.

### Phase 4 — Narrative Synthesis
Transforming the constellation of elements into coherent story systems capable of living across multiple time horizons. Produces adaptive narratives that can modulate depending on which scenario materializes, while keeping the core recognizable.

### Phase 5 — Co-creation & Community Governance
Exposing the preferable future hypothesis to dialogue with communities: customers, partners, suppliers, territories, activists. AI acts as a designed mediator to amplify significant divergences without transforming them into destructive polarization.

### Phase 6 — Activation & Specula Guardian
Translating work into concrete roadmap: projects, prototypes, releases, experiments, investments. **Specula Guardian** is a long-term accompaniment pact: monitoring the gap between imagined future and emerging reality, with an **Emergency Re-Speculation Clause** triggered when signals significantly diverge for two consecutive quarters.

## What's Open, What's Proprietary

### Open Source (This Repository)
- **Ethical Framework**: Gate structure, key questions, exclusion criteria, refusal typologies
- **Templates**: Registry of Refusals, Speculative Identity Canvas, Impact Measurement Framework
- **AI Governance Principles**: Responsible use guidelines, bias audit protocols, human-in-the-loop requirements
- **Method Documentation**: Phases, principles, application guidelines

### Proprietary
- AI system configurations and prompt libraries
- Scenario libraries and research protocols
- Specific operational facilitation tools
- Client project work and case specifics

This balance between transparency and intellectual property allows Specula to position itself as a credible actor, not another opaque formula.

## Service Models

**Specula Audit** — Diagnostic focus (~2 weeks): Analyzes brand identity state, AI maturity, coherence between declared values and practices, resilience against key scenarios.

**Specula Full Journey** — Complete process (2-3 months): All six phases with mixed Specula/client team, producing documents, prototypes, roadmaps, and policies for robust decisions on identity, products, services, and AI systems.

**Specula Guardian** — Annual accompaniment: Quarterly monitoring of how scenarios are moving, which signals confirm or deny hypotheses, where fragility, incoherence, or unexpected opportunities are emerging.

## Community & Validation

### Specula Alumni Network
A space—physical and digital—where brands that have completed a Full Journey or are in Guardian process can periodically confront each other. Not a club of polished best practices, but a place for frank exchange about what it really means to stay true to preferable futures when short-term pressures push elsewhere.

### Validation Program
Rigorous documentation of "before" and "after": starting metrics, changed decisions, transformed internal narrative, expected and unexpected effects. In later phases, activating collaborations with academic realities and research centers for longitudinal observation of method effectiveness.

### Specula Practitioner Certification
Those bringing the method to other contexts must have personally gone through a training and supervision path, not just read a manual. This ensures minimal consistency in application while leaving room for variants, adaptations, contaminations.

## Core Conviction

Talking about the future doesn't mean predicting it, but taking responsibility for steering the present toward trajectories we consider desirable. Work on speculative identity isn't stylistic exercise—it's a form of care: for people working in brands, for communities that traverse them, for ecosystems that sustain them.

Brands are no longer just communication objects. They are actors participating in writing futures. The Specula Method exists to help them do it more consciously, more imaginatively, and more responsibly.
