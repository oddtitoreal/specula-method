# Specula Community

The Specula Method is designed as shared practice, not proprietary secret. This directory supports practitioners, researchers, and organizations using the framework.

## How to Engage

### GitHub Discussions
[Visit Discussions](https://github.com/oddtitoreal/specula-method/discussions)

Topics:
- Method application questions
- Template adaptations
- Case study peer review
- Research collaborations
- Event announcements

### Alumni Network
Organizations that have completed Full Journey or are in Guardian process can join the Alumni Network—a space for frank exchange about staying true to preferable futures when short-term pressures push elsewhere.

**To join**: Complete Full Journey engagement and request invitation.

### Practitioner Certification
Coming 2026. Those bringing the method to other contexts will undergo training and supervision to ensure coherent application.

**Interest list**: Open an issue with "Practitioner Certification Interest" tag.

## Community Events
