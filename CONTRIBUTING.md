# Contributing to Specula Method

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Specula Method! This repository contains the open ethical framework and templates. Here's how you can help improve it.

## What We're Looking For

- **Improvements to the Ethical Framework**: Better questions, clearer criteria, additional considerations
- **Template Refinements**: Practical improvements based on real-world usage
- **Case Study Contributions**: Anonymized learnings from applying the method
- **Documentation Clarity**: Fixes, examples, translations
- **Bug Reports**: Gaps, contradictions, unclear guidance

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Proprietary tools or AI configurations (those remain in private repo)
- Client-specific information that hasn't been anonymized
- Theoretical additions without practical grounding
- Marketing or promotional content

## How to Contribute

### For Small Changes (typos, clarifications)
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request with clear description

### For Substantial Changes (new framework elements, templates)
1. Open an issue first describing the proposed change
2. Explain the problem it solves with real-world examples
3. Get feedback before investing time in a PR
4. Submit PR referencing the issue

### For Case Studies
1. Ensure all client information is anonymized
2. Follow the case study template in `/case-studies/README.md`
3. Focus on methodological learnings, not just results
4. Include what didn't work, not just successes

## Review Process

- All contributions reviewed by maintainers within 1 week
- We prioritize contributions from practitioners actively using the method
- Academic or research contributions welcome with proper attribution
