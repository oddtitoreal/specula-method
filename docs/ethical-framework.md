# Specula Ethical Framework

## Purpose

The Ethical Gate is not an accessory to the Specula Method—it's a structural component. It exists to ensure that speculative work doesn't become mere aesthetic exercise or rhetoric without responsibility. This framework makes visible what a brand chooses not to become, transforming refusal into identity.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Ethics as Design Constraint, Not Afterthought

The ethical dimension is introduced at the beginning of Phase 2 (Brand Archeology) and becomes an active filter in Phase 3 (Future Prototyping). It's not a post-production check but a shaping force throughout the process.

### 2. Radical Values vs. Declared Values

**Declared values** are what brands say they stand for.  
**Radical values** are the non-negotiable convictions that remain stable across all scenarios—even when inconvenient, even when costly.

The Ethical Gate works with radical values. If these aren't clearly defined, the gate cannot function.

### 3. The Registry of Refusals

What gets rejected matters as much as what gets accepted. The **Registry of Refusals** documents:
- Prototypes deliberately not pursued
- Practices considered but excluded
- Futures imagined but refused
- The reasoning behind each exclusion

Over time, this registry becomes part of the brand's identity—a record of coherence and boundaries.

## The Ethical Gate: Operational Protocol

### When It Activates

The Ethical Gate is applied to **every prototype** generated in Phase 3, before it moves forward to narrative synthesis. This includes:
- Speculative product/service concepts
- AI agent behaviors and personas
- Business model innovations
- Partnership or ecosystem plays
- Communication strategies and campaigns

### The Three Core Questions

For each prototype, the review team must answer:

#### Question 1: Value Violation
**Does this scenario violate one or more declared radical values?**

Examples of violations:
- A sustainability-focused brand exploring extractive supply chain optimization
- A human-centered brand designing systems that manipulate user behavior
- A transparency-committed brand creating deliberately opaque processes

**Decision Framework:**
- If NO: Proceed to Question 2
- If YES: Either redesign fundamentally or reject and log in Registry

#### Question 2: Harmful Practices
**Does it introduce manipulative, extractive, or exclusionary practices the brand refuses to legitimize?**

This catches scenarios that might not technically violate stated values but introduce practices incompatible with the brand's worldview:
- Dark patterns in UX
- Algorithmic discrimination
- Exploitative labor models
- Environmental externalization
- Capture of commons for private gain

**Decision Framework:**
- If NO: Proceed to Question 3
- If YES: Either redesign fundamentally or reject and log in Registry

#### Question 3: Unacceptable Dependencies
**Does it create technological, social, or environmental dependencies we consider unacceptable—even if profitable?**

This addresses second-order effects and systemic implications:
- Creating addiction loops
- Generating waste that can't be processed
- Building vendor lock-in that limits user sovereignty
- Establishing power asymmetries in ecosystems
- Enabling surveillance capitalism models

**Decision Framework:**
- If NO: Prototype passes the Ethical Gate
- If YES: Either redesign fundamentally or reject and log in Registry

## Registry of Refusals: Template

### Entry Structure

Each refused prototype should be documented with:

```markdown
## [Prototype Name/Code]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Phase**: [Scenario Generation / Prototyping / etc.]  
**Scenario Context**: Brief description of the future scenario this prototype addressed

### Description
What the prototype was: product, service, AI agent behavior, business model, etc.

### Why It Was Refused
Which question(s) it failed, and specifically how:
- [ ] Q1: Value Violation — [Specify which radical value(s)]
- [ ] Q2: Harmful Practices — [Specify which practices]
- [ ] Q3: Unacceptable Dependencies — [Specify which dependencies]

### Reasoning
The discussion and reasoning that led to refusal. Include:
- Key arguments made
- Tensions or disagreements surfaced
- Alternative approaches considered
- Why redesign wasn't pursued (if applicable)

### Learning
What this refusal teaches about the brand's boundaries and identity.

### Example Entry

```markdown
## Hyper-Personalized Predictive Shopping Assistant

**Date**: 2025-11-15  
**Phase**: Future Prototyping  
**Scenario Context**: Scenario 2 - "Algorithmic Intimacy Economy" (2030)

### Description
An AI shopping assistant that predicts user needs before they're consciously formed, using continuous behavioral monitoring, purchase history, social media sentiment analysis, and biometric data. Automatically executes purchases when confidence threshold is met.

### Why It Was Refused
- [x] Q1: Value Violation — Violates "User Sovereignty" radical value
- [x] Q2: Harmful Practices — Introduces manipulative prediction patterns
- [ ] Q3: Unacceptable Dependencies — 

### Reasoning
While the prototype could significantly increase conversion and customer "satisfaction" (measured as reduced decision fatigue), the team identified three critical issues:

1. **Erosion of agency**: System makes decisions for users, training them out of conscious choice-making
2. **Data asymmetry**: Requires surveillance-level data collection incompatible with our privacy stance
3. **Manufactured needs**: Risk of creating demand that serves business metrics rather than genuine user wellbeing

Alternative explored: "Shopping companion that surfaces questions rather than answers" - but this felt like ethics-washing the same mechanism.

### Learning
Our commitment to user sovereignty means we refuse to optimize away human decision-making, even when users might welcome it in the moment. Convenience cannot trump agency.

- Links to refused prototype: "Gamified Consumption Streaks" (different reasons)

## AI Governance Integration

### Human-in-the-Loop Requirements

**Mandatory for all ethical decisions:**
- No AI system can autonomously determine if a prototype passes the Ethical Gate
- Minimum of two senior reviewers per decision (ideally from different backgrounds)
- Explicit documentation of who made the decision and on what basis

### AI Role in Ethical Review

AI can assist by:
- Surfacing relevant precedents from past decisions
- Identifying potential second-order effects humans might miss
- Generating edge cases for stress-testing
- Synthesizing discussion notes into structured entries

AI cannot:
- Make final determination on value alignment
- Override human ethical judgment
- Dilute or rationalize violations to make prototypes "passable"

### Bias Monitoring

Before each project, review:
- What data is the AI using to generate prototypes?
- What biases might be embedded in those training sets?
- Are we seeing systematic exclusion of certain groups or perspectives?
- Are "plausible" scenarios defaulting to extractive capitalist logic?

---

## Governance Structure

### Review Team Composition

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 2 reviewers per prototype
- At least 1 person with no direct stake in the prototype's success
- At least 1 person with expertise in ethics, social impact, or critical design

**Recommended:**
- Include someone from the community the prototype would affect
- Rotate reviewers to avoid groupthink
- Document conflicts of interest

### Decision Process

1. **Individual Review**: Each reviewer independently evaluates against the three questions
2. **Discussion**: Team discusses divergent assessments
3. **Consensus or Escalation**: Aim for consensus; if impossible, escalate to client leadership
4. **Documentation**: Log decision in Registry (whether accepted or refused)

### Escalation Path

If the review team cannot reach consensus:
1. Bring to client leadership with all perspectives documented
2. Leadership makes final call but cannot override radical values without formal process
3. If radical values themselves are in question, trigger broader stakeholder engagement

## Red Flags & Common Failure Modes

### Ethics as Theater
**Symptom**: Going through Ethical Gate motions but always finding ways to pass prototypes  
**Response**: Audit the Registry - if it's empty or minimal, the gate isn't working

### Values Drift
**Symptom**: Radical values getting "reinterpreted" to accommodate profitable prototypes  
**Response**: Compare current value statements to original Brand Archeology output

### Fatigue & Erosion
**Symptom**: Team starts viewing Ethical Gate as bureaucratic obstacle  
**Response**: Return to Phase 2 work - why do these values matter? What are they protecting?

### False Binary Thinking
**Symptom**: "Either we do this unethical thing or we're not competitive"  
**Response**: That's exactly when speculative thinking matters most - what's the third option?

## Using This Framework

### For Practitioners

1. **At Project Start**: Establish radical values clearly in Phase 2
2. **Before Prototyping**: Brief the team on the three questions and Registry purpose
3. **During Review**: Use the template, don't rush, document thoroughly
4. **After Project**: Review Registry as identity artifact, not just compliance log

### For Organizations

1. **Pre-Engagement**: Determine if you're ready to refuse profitable futures
2. **During Engagement**: Assign authority to make binding ethical decisions
3. **Post-Engagement**: Use Registry in onboarding, strategy reviews, public communication

### For Researchers & Validators

1. Study patterns across multiple Registries (anonymized)
2. Identify common refusal categories by sector/context
3. Develop more nuanced question frameworks for specific domains
4. Publish findings to strengthen collective practice

## Evolution & Adaptation

This framework is a living document. Improvements come from:
- Real-world application and failure
- Community dialogue and critique
- Academic validation and research
- Technological and social context shifts

**How to propose changes:**
1. Open an issue describing the limitation or gap
2. Provide concrete examples from practice
3. Suggest specific modifications to questions or process
4. Engage in discussion with practitioners and researchers

---

## Final Note

The Ethical Gate is not about being "good" in some abstract sense. It's about coherence: ensuring that the futures a brand works toward are futures it would actually want to inhabit. It's about making visible the boundaries of identity, not just the aspirations.

Refusal is not failure. Refusal is precision.
