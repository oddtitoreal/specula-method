## Combination Approaches

### Audit → Full Journey
Most common path. Audit de-risks commitment.

**Combined Investment**: Slight discount if Full Journey follows within 2 months.

### Full Journey → Guardian
Ideal for long-term identity stewardship.

**Combined Investment**: Guardian pricing reduced 15-20% when contracted with Full Journey.

### Audit → Guardian (without Full Journey)
Possible but rare. Guardian works best with Full Journey foundation.
