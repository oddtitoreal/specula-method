# Method Evolution Log
## Progressive definition of the Specula Method

This file tracks the evolution of the Specula Method and defines, step by step, what the method is at each version. It is not a technical changelog; it is a progressive definition.

---

## How to use this log
- Each version adds, clarifies, or refines what the method *is*.
- When updating the method, record: what changed, why, and what it enables or excludes.
- Keep the language operational, not marketing.

## Versions

### v1.0.1 (February 2026)
**Definition**: Patch update of the open documentation profile, keeping the six-phase public structure and improving runtime alignment clarity.

**Core updates**:
- Runtime-compatible schema profile explicitly documented and linked.
- Agent protocol constraints hardened (`MODE | PHASE`, canonical phase sequence with `0` and `1.5`).
- Mapping intent clarified against the private v2.4.5.x evolution track without changing the public six-phase model.

**What this enables**:
- More consistent agent outputs across workshop and runtime contexts.
- Lower integration ambiguity between open method assets and executable framework runtimes.

**What this does not change**:
- Public method release remains `v1.x`.
- Six-phase public narrative and ethical structure remain unchanged.

---

### v1.0 (January 2026)
**Definition**: A six-phase strategic foresight branding method that uses scenarios to build living brand identities oriented to preferable futures, with a formal ethical gate and a long-term governance layer.

**Core structure**:
- Six phases: Scenario Generation, Competitive Futures Mapping, Brand Archeology, Future Prototyping & Ethical Gate, Narrative Synthesis, Activation & Specula Guardian.
- Ethical Gate as non-negotiable checkpoint with documented refusals.
- Specula Guardian as ongoing monitoring and re-speculation trigger.

**What this enables**:
- Cross-scenario coherence without collapsing to a single "best" future.
- Explicit refusal policy as part of identity.
- Continuous adaptation anchored to radical values.

**What this excludes**:
- Single-scenario, campaign-only branding.
- Purpose statements without operational commitments.

---

### pre-1.0 (Foundational draft)
**Definition**: Early specification of Specula as a speculative identity method merging futures thinking, brand strategy, and AI-assisted divergence.

**Core structure**:
- Multi-scenario exploration as the starting point.
- Brand identity anchored to non-negotiable values.
- AI as a divergence partner, not as a shortcut.

**Limitations**:
- Governance and monitoring layers not fully formalized.
- Templates and refusal registry still embryonic.

---

## Planned increments (placeholders)

### v1.1 (Planned)
**Focus**: Consolidation of templates and facilitation protocol; clearer success metrics.

**To define**:
- Any phase-level changes.
- New artifacts or retired artifacts.
- Updates to the Ethical Gate.
