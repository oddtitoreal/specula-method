# Specula Method Overview
## Six Phases of Strategic Foresight Branding

This document provides a high-level overview of the complete Specula Method. For detailed operational guidance, see the templates directory.

## The Core Question

Traditional branding asks: "How do we position ourselves in today's market?"

Specula asks: "What futures do we want to help make possible?"

From that question, we work backward to design identities, products, services, and AI agents that can operate in those futures without losing deep coherence.

## The Six Phases

### Phase 1: Scenario Generation
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Output**: 4-8 future scenarios combining cultural, technological, economic, regulatory, and environmental drivers

Opening the field through multiple possible and desirable futures. Not predictions, but explorations.

**Key Activities**:
- Desk research and trend analysis
- Stakeholder interviews
- AI-assisted weak signal detection
- Scenario construction (plausible + preferable)

**Unique Element**: Deliberately generating "uncomfortable" scenarios where the brand doesn't exist, where its values are co-opted, or where its value proposition becomes irrelevant. These negative scenarios clarify what truly matters.

---

### Phase 1.5: Competitive Futures Mapping
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Output**: Visual map of where competitors are positioning in future scenarios, identification of "white spaces"

Before diving into brand identity, observe what others are doing—or could do.

**Key Activities**:
- Analysis of competitor R&D investments, partnerships, messaging shifts
- Mapping along dimensions like: innovation radicalness, ethical depth, technological intensity, co-creation openness
- Identifying saturated territories vs. white spaces

**Goal**: Find futures no one is credibly occupying yet.

---

### Phase 2: Brand Archeology
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Output**: Speculative Identity Canvas, DNA document with radical values, accepted biases, and inviolable boundaries

Excavating what must remain stable across multiple scenarios.

**Key Activities**:
- Workshops with internal teams
- Analysis of past decisions, conflicts, compromises
- AI-assisted pattern recognition in existing communications
- Completion of Speculative Identity Canvas (six dimensions)

**Unique Element**: Defining not just values, but **radical values**—those that remain non-negotiable even when inconvenient or costly. Also defining accepted biases: explicit preferences (e.g., regenerative approaches, mutualistic practices).

**Output**: The brand's DNA document serves as compass for prototyping and criterion for the Ethical Gate.

---

### Phase 3: Future Prototyping & Ethical Gate
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Output**: 3-5 tested prototypes of brand identity in different futures, Registry of Refusals

Testing the brand in different futures: What does it become? What role does it play? What AI agents would embody its will?

**Key Activities**:
- Speculative design exercises
- Storytelling and service storyboarding
- Resilience Protocol: stress-testing against 4 scenarios (recession, regulation, tech disruption, wild card)
- Ethical Gate review of every prototype

**The Ethical Gate**: Formal checkpoint asking three questions:
1. Does this violate radical values?
2. Does it introduce manipulative/extractive/exclusionary practices?
3. Does it create unacceptable dependencies?

**Registry of Refusals**: Prototypes deliberately rejected are documented, becoming part of the identity—what the brand chose not to become.

---

### Phase 4: Narrative Synthesis
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Output**: Meta-narrative, operational storylines, dynamic guidelines

Transforming the constellation of elements into coherent story systems.

**Key Activities**:
- Crafting adaptive narratives that modulate based on which scenario materializes
- Developing meta-narrative (which future the brand is making more probable)
- Creating operational storylines for products, services, AI agents
- Writing dynamic guidelines for maintaining coherence

**Not**: A "big idea" campaign.  
**But**: A trama of narratives that live across time horizons while keeping the core recognizable.

---

### Phase 5: Co-creation & Community Governance
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Output**: Validated/refined identity through community dialogue, documented agreements and disagreements

Exposing the preferable future hypothesis to dialogue with communities.

**Key Activities**:
- Synchronous workshops and futuring sessions
- Asynchronous platforms, surveys, conversational agents
- AI-mediated aggregation of contributions
- Identifying and amplifying minority voices with important perspectives

**Boundary**: Community can influence many things, but not the radical values and ethical perimeter established in Phase 2.

**Output**: Identity is no longer just a consultancy artifact, but a negotiated position between brand and community—with disagreements declared, not hidden.

---

### Phase 6: Activation & Specula Guardian
**Duration**: Ongoing  
**Output**: 12-month roadmap, Guardian monitoring system, potential Re-Speculation cycles

Translating work into concrete action and long-term accompaniment.

**Key Activities**:
- Prioritizing first 12 months of projects/experiments
- Defining metrics to monitor (hybrid framework)
- Setting up Guardian quarterly reviews
- Establishing Emergency Re-Speculation triggers

**Specula Guardian**: Not just a retainer, but a pact to monitor the gap between imagined future and emerging reality. If signals diverge significantly for two consecutive quarters, triggers a 4-week accelerated re-speculation cycle.

**Emergency Re-Speculation Clause**: Rialigns the brand to new landscape without losing its core.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Structural Ethics
The Ethical Gate isn't optional—it's a formal phase with documentation requirements. Refusal is logged and becomes identity.

### 2. AI as Divergence Partner
AI is configured for high-temperature exploration, generating uncomfortable combinations that humans tend to ignore. Not for efficiency, but for expanded possibility.

### 3. Hybrid Impact Metrics
Measuring process quality, business performance, AND systemic impact. Not one or the other.

### 4. Evolutionary Design
Guardian isn't maintenance—it's a living relationship where the brand's identity evolves while staying anchored to radical values.

## Specula Method Agent

For facilitated sessions, Specula provides a dedicated agent protocol that configures an LLM to guide teams through the method: one question at a time, explicit phase tracking, anti-fluff input gathering, and reusable outputs. The protocol supports both conceptual and runtime-compatible JSON contracts. See [Specula Method Agent](../agent/specula-method-agent.md) and the [Runtime Alignment Guide](runtime-alignment.md).
