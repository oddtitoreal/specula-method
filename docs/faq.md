# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Specula Method?

Specula is a strategic foresight branding method that uses multiple future scenarios as tools to build adaptive brand identities. Instead of asking "how do we position ourselves today?", it asks "what futures do we want to help make possible?" and works backward from there.

It combines speculative design, brand strategy, and governed AI to create identities that can remain coherent across different future scenarios while staying anchored to radical values.

### Is this just futurism or scenario planning?

No. Traditional scenario planning explores possible futures to inform strategy. Specula goes further:
- It designs brand *identities* for those futures, not just strategies
- It includes an Ethical Gate that filters prototypes based on values
- It creates a Registry of Refusals—documenting what the brand chose not to become
- It establishes Guardian monitoring for continuous alignment

### Who is this for?

Organizations that:
- Take their values seriously enough to refuse profitable futures
- Operate in rapidly changing contexts
- Want AI governance that goes beyond compliance
- Are willing to invest time in deep identity work
- Value long-term coherence over short-term optimization

Not for: Brands seeking quick wins, trend-chasing, or purely cosmetic repositioning.

## Method Questions

### How long does it take?

**Specula Audit**: 2 weeks effective work over 3-4 weeks calendar  
**Full Journey**: 2-3 months effective work over 3-4 months calendar  
**Guardian**: Ongoing, quarterly check-ins plus as-needed support

See [Investment Framework](./investment-framework.md) for details.

### Can we do just some phases?

The six phases are designed as an integrated system. Skipping phases (especially Phase 2 Brand Archeology or Phase 3 Ethical Gate) undermines the method's coherence.

That said:
- **Audit** is a valid standalone diagnostic
- **Competitive Futures Mapping** can be extracted as a service
- **Guardian** requires Full Journey foundation

### What if our values aren't clear yet?

Phase 2 (Brand Archeology) is designed to excavate and clarify values. You don't need perfect clarity to start—you need willingness to do the excavation work.

If your organization has fundamental disagreement about core values, Specula will surface that. This can be uncomfortable but is necessary before identity design.

### What's "AI-assisted" mean exactly?

AI is used to:
- Analyze large volumes of trend reports, articles, stakeholder input
- Generate scenario combinations humans might not consider
- Facilitate conversations through maieutic questioning
- Synthesize workshop materials into coherent narratives
- Stress-test prototypes against scenarios

AI is NOT used to:
- Make strategic decisions
- Determine value alignment
- Override human judgment
- Generate content without human review

See [AI Governance](./ai-governance.md) for detailed principles.

## Ethical Framework Questions

### What if a prototype fails the Ethical Gate?

Three options:
1. **Redesign** to resolve the violation
2. **Reject** and log in Registry of Refusals
3. **Challenge the gate** by revisiting radical values (rare, requires executive decision)

The Registry of Refusals isn't a failure log—it's identity documentation. What you refuse to become is as important as what you choose to become.

### Who decides what passes the gate?

Minimum of two reviewers, ideally with different backgrounds (strategy, ethics, design, community representation). Final decisions involve client leadership, but they cannot override the gate without formally revisiting radical values.

See [Ethical Framework](./ethical-framework.md) for governance structure.

### Can the Ethical Gate be customized?

The three core questions are standard, but:
- Radical values are unique to each organization
- Specific criteria for "harmful practices" vary by context
- "Unacceptable dependencies" are defined per brand

The *structure* is fixed; the *content* is customized.

### What if we disagree internally on ethics?

That's valuable data. Specula surfaces those disagreements in Phase 2 rather than letting them fester. The process helps teams reach explicit agreement or acknowledge irreconcilable differences.

If differences are irreconcilable, that's information the organization needs before moving forward.

## Practical Application Questions

### Do we need technical AI expertise?

No. Specula practitioners handle the AI governance and configuration. Clients need:
- Strategic clarity about brand direction
- Willingness to engage with scenarios and prototypes
- Time commitment from key stakeholders
- Openness to uncomfortable questions

Technical AI work is our responsibility, not yours.

### What if our scenarios don't materialize?

That's not the point. Scenarios are tools for testing identity resilience, not predictions. Even if a specific scenario doesn't occur, the process of prototyping your brand in that scenario reveals:
- What's truly non-negotiable
- Where you're vulnerable
- What adaptations maintain coherence
- What you refuse to become

The value is in the design process, not prediction accuracy.

### Can we keep this internal (not public)?

Absolutely. The method itself is open-source, but your application of it—your scenarios, prototypes, Registry of Refusals, DNA document—can remain entirely confidential.

Some clients choose to make parts public (e.g., their Ethical Gate criteria) for credibility. Others keep everything internal. Your choice.

### How do we measure success?

Three layers (see [Templates](../templates/operational-templates.md#template-6-impact-measurement-framework)):

1. **Process Metrics**: Decision velocity, internal alignment, conflict reduction
2. **Business Performance**: Sector-specific KPIs (consideration, retention, win rate, etc.)
3. **Systemic Impact**: Coherence between declared future and actual transformation

Dashboard is customized per organization. No universal KPI set.

## Philosophical Questions

### Isn't this just expensive navel-gazing?

Fair question. Specula is expensive and time-intensive. It's not for everyone.

It's valuable when:
- Your values actually constrain your choices (not just marketing)
- You operate in contexts where identity drift is costly
- You're building for 5-10 year horizons, not next quarter
- You want coherence across rapid change

It's navel-gazing when:
- You're not willing to refuse profitable futures
- Leadership isn't committed to the process
- It becomes aesthetic exercise without behavioral change

The Registry of Refusals and Guardian monitoring exist specifically to prevent this.

### Why open-source the ethical framework?

Because ethics shouldn't be proprietary. If we're claiming to help brands make responsible AI choices, we need to show our work.

Making the framework open:
- Allows peer critique and improvement
- Makes it harder to ethics-wash
- Creates community accountability
- Enables academic validation

We keep proprietary: AI configurations, scenario libraries, operational protocols. The *how we implement* remains ours. The *principles we follow* should be shared.

### What's the relationship between Specula and the private framework repo?

The private repo ([specula-framework](https://github.com/oddtitoreal/specula-framework)) contains complete operational documentation for client delivery: detailed schemas, AI prompts, governance specs, project templates, and executable runtime assets.

This public repo (specula-method) contains the open ethical framework, templates, and method overview.

Think of it as: private repo is the professional toolkit, public repo is the open standard.
