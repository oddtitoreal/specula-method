# Case Studies

This directory contains anonymized case studies from Specula Method applications. Each study focuses on methodological learnings, challenges, and insights rather than just results.

## Principles for Case Studies

### Anonymization
- Client identity protected unless explicit permission granted
- Specific metrics generalized
- Context provided without identifying details

### Focus on Method
- How phases were applied
- What worked and what didn't
- Adaptations made to standard process
- Insights for future applications

### Honesty About Limitations
- Failures and struggles documented
- Unexpected challenges highlighted
- Areas where method fell short
