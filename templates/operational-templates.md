# Specula Method: Operational Templates

This document contains ready-to-use templates for key Specula Method activities. Each template is designed to be adapted to your specific context while maintaining methodological coherence.

## Template 1: Speculative Identity Canvas

### Purpose
Capture the six dimensions of brand identity that must remain coherent across multiple future scenarios. Used in Phase 2 (Brand Archeology).

### Instructions
Work through each dimension with your team. Don't aim for perfection—aim for honesty. Tensions and contradictions are valuable data.

## Using These Templates

### Adaptation Guidelines

1. **Don't use templates as checklists** — Use them as structured thinking tools
2. **Modify freely** — These are starting points, not prescriptions
3. **Document changes** — Note why you adapted and what you learned
4. **Share improvements** — If you find better questions or structures, contribute back

### Integration into Workflow

- **Canvas**: Use in early Phase 2 workshops, revisit quarterly
- **Ethical Gate**: Apply to every prototype, no exceptions
- **Registry**: Update immediately after decisions, review semi-annually
- **Futures Map**: Create once at project start, update when new players emerge
- **Resilience**: Apply to shortlisted prototypes before final selection
- **Impact**: Set up at project kickoff, review at defined intervals

---

## Contributing Improvements

Found a gap? Tested a modification? Have a better question?

1. Open an issue describing the limitation
2. Propose specific changes with rationale
3. Share (anonymized) examples from practice
4. Engage in discussion

These templates improve through use. Your experience makes them better for everyone.
